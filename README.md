This code allows I2C communication between a BeagleBoneBlack and an Adafruit BNO055 IMU. It is a simplified/streamlined/fixed version of the code availible at/reffered to by [this tutorial](https://learn.adafruit.com/bno055-absolute-orientation-sensor-with-raspberry-pi-and-beaglebone-black), an Adafruit tutorial. The code has been simlified to work only over I2C with a BeagleBoneBlack on channel 2.
